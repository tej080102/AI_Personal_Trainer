# 💪 AI Personal Trainer

An AI-powered personal trainer built with **Streamlit**, supporting **workout logging, analytics, and AI-driven coaching**.  
You can run it in **two modes**:
- **Local (`app.py`)** → Runs on your machine using [Ollama](https://ollama.ai) with the `mistral` model.  
- **Cloud (`app2.py`)** → Uses the Hugging Face Inference API (no local model needed).  

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Workout Logging**  
  - Input workouts in plain English (e.g., *“10 pushups, bench press 50kg x 3 sets, 5 km run in 25 min”*).  
  - Supports **strength** (sets, reps, weight) and **cardio** (distance, duration).  
  - Automatic parsing and structured storage.

- **Authentication System**  
  - Sign up & log in with username + password (securely hashed).  
  - Each user has isolated workout history.  
  ![Login](assets/login.png)

- **Analytics Dashboard**  
  - Training split (strength vs cardio sessions).  
  - **Strength progress** via *training volume* (sets × reps × weight).  
  - **Cardio progress** via *distance* or *pace (min/km)* toggle.  
  - Personal Records (PRs): best lifts, longest runs, fastest times.

- **AI Coach**  
  - Training progression recommendations.  
  - Nutrition guidance.  
  - Safe tips for injury prevention.  
  - Exercise form corrections.  
  - Encouraging, concise responses.

   ollama pull mistral
   ```
3. Run:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## 🔧 Database
- Uses SQLite (`trainer.db`).  
- Tables auto-created with `init_db()`.  
- To seed with sample workouts:
  ```bash
  python seed_db.py
  ```
- Default test user:
  ```
  Username: testuser
  Password: password123
  ```

---

## 📊 Example Analytics
- **Strength** → Training volume trend (kg × reps × sets).  
- **Cardio** → Distance or Pace toggle.  
- **Split** → Strength vs cardio sessions this week.  
- **PRs** → Highest weights, longest runs, fastest paces.

## 🙌 Notes
- Local mode requires Ollama installed separately.  
- Hugging Face mode may be rate-limited on free API keys.  
- Extendable: add new exercise types, integrate wearables, or connect external APIs.
